# Mining Notifications Fix (Start & Complete)

## Problem Identified
The server was not sending push notifications for mining events:
1. **Mining Start:** No notification when user clicks "Start Mine"
2. **Mining Complete:** No notification when mining sessions completed

The issues were:
- Missing notification logic in the start mining endpoint
- Missing notification logic in the scheduled task that checks for expired sessions

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Mining Start Notification
**File:** `mine-server-app/server.js`
**Location:** Lines 1015-1035 (after successful session start)

```javascript
// Send push notification for mining start
if (userData.pushToken) {
  try {
    await sendPushNotification(userData.pushToken, {
      title: '‚õèÔ∏è Mining Started!',
      body: 'Your 2-hour mining session has begun! You\'ll receive a notification when it completes.',
      data: {
        type: 'mining_start',
        action: 'navigate_to_home',
        sessionDuration: 7200 // 2 hours in seconds
      }
    });
    logger.mining('Push notification sent for mining start', {
      userId,
      pushToken: userData.pushToken,
      sessionStartTime: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to send push notification for mining start', {
      userId,
      error: error.message,
      pushToken: userData.pushToken
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Added Mining Complete Notification to Scheduled Task
**File:** `mine-server-app/server.js`
**Location:** Lines 1508-1530 (after session completion logging)

```javascript
// Send push notification for mining completion
if (user.pushToken) {
  try {
    await sendPushNotification(user.pushToken, {
      title: 'Mining Complete! üéâ',
      body: `Congratulations! You've earned ${finalEarnings.toFixed(6)} coins from your mining session.`,
      data: {
        type: 'mining_complete',
        action: 'navigate_to_home',
        earnings: finalEarnings
      }
    });
    logger.mining('Push notification sent for mining completion (scheduled task)', {
      userId: doc.id,
      pushToken: user.pushToken,
      earnings: finalEarnings
    });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to send push notification (scheduled task)', {
      userId: doc.id,
      error: error.message,
      pushToken: user.pushToken
    });
  }
}
```

### 3. Fixed Async/Await Issue
**Problem:** The original code used `forEach()` which doesn't support `await`
**Solution:** Changed to `for...of` loop to properly handle async operations

```javascript
// Before (broken):
snapshot.forEach(doc => {
  // ... async operations with await (doesn't work)
});

// After (fixed):
for (const doc of snapshot.docs) {
  // ... async operations with await (works correctly)
}
```

### 4. Added Test Endpoint
**File:** `mine-server-app/server.js`
**Endpoint:** `POST /test-notification`

This endpoint allows manual testing of the notification system:
- Requires authentication
- Sends a test notification to verify the system works
- Returns detailed error information if it fails

## How It Works Now

### Mining Start Flow:
1. **User clicks "Start Mine"** in the app
2. **Server validates** all anti-cheat checks
3. **Session starts** with server timestamp
4. **Database updated** with mining session data
5. **Notification sent** to user's device: "‚õèÔ∏è Mining Started!"
6. **Logging** records the notification success/failure

### Mining Complete Flow:
1. **Scheduled Task:** Runs every 10 minutes (600,000ms)
2. **Session Detection:** Finds all users with `isMining: true`
3. **Duration Check:** Calculates if session has exceeded 2 hours
4. **Database Update:** Updates user data with earnings and session end
5. **Notification Send:** Sends push notification to user's device: "Mining Complete! üéâ"
6. **Logging:** Logs success/failure for monitoring

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Manual Test (Immediate)
1. Get your Firebase ID token from the app
2. Make a POST request to: `https://raw-full-app-with-server.onrender.com/test-notification`
3. Include in body: `{ "userId": "your-user-id" }`
4. Include header: `Authorization: Bearer <your-firebase-token>`

### Method 2: Real Session Test
1. Start a mining session in the app
2. Check if you receive a "Mining Started!" notification immediately
3. Wait for 2 hours (or modify server code temporarily to test with shorter duration)
4. Check if you receive a "Mining Complete!" notification
5. Verify in server logs: `"Push notification sent for mining start"` and `"Push notification sent for mining completion (scheduled task)"`

### Method 3: Server Log Monitoring
Check server logs for these messages:
- ‚úÖ Mining Start Success: `"Push notification sent for mining start"`
- ‚úÖ Mining Complete Success: `"Push notification sent for mining completion (scheduled task)"`
- ‚ùå Mining Start Failure: `"Failed to send push notification for mining start"`
- ‚ùå Mining Complete Failure: `"Failed to send push notification (scheduled task)"`
- üìä Info: `"Session completion check started"` and `"Session completion check finished"`

## Verification Commands

### Check Server Health
```bash
curl https://raw-full-app-with-server.onrender.com/health
```

### Monitor Server Logs
The server logs to `mine-server-app/logs/` directory:
- `mining-YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Mining session events
- `error-YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Error messages
- `errors.log` - All errors

## External Verification

To verify "outside any API" as requested:

1. **Server Logs:** Check the log files directly on the server
2. **Push Notification Service:** Monitor Expo's push notification delivery
3. **Device Logs:** Check device notification history
4. **Database:** Verify `lastMiningEnd` timestamps in Firestore
5. **Real-time Monitoring:** Watch server logs during a mining session

## Files Modified

1. **`mine-server-app/server.js`**
   - Added notification logic to scheduled task (lines 1508-1530)
   - Fixed async/await issue by changing `forEach` to `for...of`
   - Added test notification endpoint

2. **`mine-server-app/test-notification.js`** (new file)
   - Test script to verify server accessibility
   - Provides testing instructions

## Security Considerations

- All notifications require valid authentication
- Push tokens are validated before sending
- Failed notifications are logged for debugging
- Anti-cheat measures remain intact during session completion

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated server code
2. Test with a real mining session
3. Monitor server logs for notification success
4. Verify notifications are received on devices

## Troubleshooting

If notifications still don't work:

1. **Check Push Token:** Verify user has a valid push token in database
2. **Check Authentication:** Ensure Firebase token is valid
3. **Check Network:** Verify Expo push service is accessible
4. **Check Logs:** Look for specific error messages in server logs
5. **Test Endpoint:** Use `/test-notification` to isolate the issue

The fix ensures that mining completion notifications will now be sent automatically when sessions expire, providing users with immediate feedback about their earnings.
