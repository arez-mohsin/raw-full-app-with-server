# Mining Completion Notification Fix

## Problem Identified
The server was not sending push notifications when mining sessions completed. The issue was in the scheduled task that runs every 10 minutes to check for expired mining sessions.

## Root Cause
The scheduled task in `server.js` (lines 1380-1520) was updating the database when mining sessions expired but was **missing the push notification logic**. The task was only updating user data but not calling `sendPushNotification()`.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Notification Logic to Scheduled Task
**File:** `mine-server-app/server.js`
**Location:** Lines 1508-1530 (after session completion logging)

```javascript
// Send push notification for mining completion
if (user.pushToken) {
  try {
    await sendPushNotification(user.pushToken, {
      title: 'Mining Complete! üéâ',
      body: `Congratulations! You've earned ${finalEarnings.toFixed(6)} coins from your mining session.`,
      data: {
        type: 'mining_complete',
        action: 'navigate_to_home',
        earnings: finalEarnings
      }
    });
    logger.mining('Push notification sent for mining completion (scheduled task)', {
      userId: doc.id,
      pushToken: user.pushToken,
      earnings: finalEarnings
    });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to send push notification (scheduled task)', {
      userId: doc.id,
      error: error.message,
      pushToken: user.pushToken
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Async/Await Issue
**Problem:** The original code used `forEach()` which doesn't support `await`
**Solution:** Changed to `for...of` loop to properly handle async operations

```javascript
// Before (broken):
snapshot.forEach(doc => {
  // ... async operations with await (doesn't work)
});

// After (fixed):
for (const doc of snapshot.docs) {
  // ... async operations with await (works correctly)
}
```

### 3. Added Test Endpoint
**File:** `mine-server-app/server.js`
**Endpoint:** `POST /test-notification`

This endpoint allows manual testing of the notification system:
- Requires authentication
- Sends a test notification to verify the system works
- Returns detailed error information if it fails

## How It Works Now

1. **Scheduled Task:** Runs every 10 minutes (600,000ms)
2. **Session Detection:** Finds all users with `isMining: true`
3. **Duration Check:** Calculates if session has exceeded 2 hours
4. **Database Update:** Updates user data with earnings and session end
5. **Notification Send:** Sends push notification to user's device
6. **Logging:** Logs success/failure for monitoring

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Manual Test (Immediate)
1. Get your Firebase ID token from the app
2. Make a POST request to: `https://raw-full-app-with-server.onrender.com/test-notification`
3. Include in body: `{ "userId": "your-user-id" }`
4. Include header: `Authorization: Bearer <your-firebase-token>`

### Method 2: Real Session Test
1. Start a mining session in the app
2. Wait for 2 hours (or modify server code temporarily to test with shorter duration)
3. Check if you receive a push notification
4. Verify in server logs: `"Push notification sent for mining completion (scheduled task)"`

### Method 3: Server Log Monitoring
Check server logs for these messages:
- ‚úÖ Success: `"Push notification sent for mining completion (scheduled task)"`
- ‚ùå Failure: `"Failed to send push notification (scheduled task)"`
- üìä Info: `"Session completion check started"` and `"Session completion check finished"`

## Verification Commands

### Check Server Health
```bash
curl https://raw-full-app-with-server.onrender.com/health
```

### Monitor Server Logs
The server logs to `mine-server-app/logs/` directory:
- `mining-YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Mining session events
- `error-YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Error messages
- `errors.log` - All errors

## External Verification

To verify "outside any API" as requested:

1. **Server Logs:** Check the log files directly on the server
2. **Push Notification Service:** Monitor Expo's push notification delivery
3. **Device Logs:** Check device notification history
4. **Database:** Verify `lastMiningEnd` timestamps in Firestore
5. **Real-time Monitoring:** Watch server logs during a mining session

## Files Modified

1. **`mine-server-app/server.js`**
   - Added notification logic to scheduled task (lines 1508-1530)
   - Fixed async/await issue by changing `forEach` to `for...of`
   - Added test notification endpoint

2. **`mine-server-app/test-notification.js`** (new file)
   - Test script to verify server accessibility
   - Provides testing instructions

## Security Considerations

- All notifications require valid authentication
- Push tokens are validated before sending
- Failed notifications are logged for debugging
- Anti-cheat measures remain intact during session completion

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated server code
2. Test with a real mining session
3. Monitor server logs for notification success
4. Verify notifications are received on devices

## Troubleshooting

If notifications still don't work:

1. **Check Push Token:** Verify user has a valid push token in database
2. **Check Authentication:** Ensure Firebase token is valid
3. **Check Network:** Verify Expo push service is accessible
4. **Check Logs:** Look for specific error messages in server logs
5. **Test Endpoint:** Use `/test-notification` to isolate the issue

The fix ensures that mining completion notifications will now be sent automatically when sessions expire, providing users with immediate feedback about their earnings.
